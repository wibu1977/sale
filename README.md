This project focuses on analyzing customer data using SQL to gain insights into sales performance, product segmentation, profitability, discounts impact, price tracking, price elasticity, and cross-selling opportunities. The project utilizes a dataset called customer_sale to perform various SQL queries and generate meaningful results.

Analyzing Sales Performance Over Time

The project begins by analyzing sales performance over time. It retrieves the gross sales, sales, and discounts data from the customer_sale table.

Identifying Sales by Product, Segment, and Country

The next step involves identifying sales by product, segment, and country. The SQL query calculates the total sales for each combination of product, segment, and country, and presents the results in descending order. The top 10 sales records are displayed.

Top 10 Customers Using Products the Most

This section focuses on identifying the top 10 customers who use the products the most. The query calculates the sales for the years 2013 and 2014, compares them, and calculates the sales growth percentage. The results are grouped by segment and country.

Profitability of Each Segment

The profitability of each segment is analyzed in this section. The query calculates the profit for the years 2013 and 2014 for each segment, and presents the results in descending order.

Profitability of Each Product

Similar to the previous section, this part focuses on the profitability of each product. The query calculates the profit for the years 2013 and 2014 for each product, and presents the results in descending order.

Analyzing the Impact of Discounts on Profitability

This section investigates the impact of discounts on profitability. The query calculates the discount percentage for each record and presents it alongside the gross sales, total discounts, and total profit. The average discount percentage is also calculated based on discount brackets.

Tracking Price for Different Products and Segments Over Time

The project tracks the price changes for different products and segments over time. The query retrieves the sale price for the years 2013 and 2014, categorized by product and segment.

Calculating Price Elasticity for Products and Segments

Price elasticity is examined in this section. The SQL query calculates the price elasticity by comparing the current and previous prices and quantities sold for each product and segment.

Finding Cross-Selling Opportunities Across Segments
The last part of the project focuses on identifying cross-selling opportunities across segments. The query calculates the total sales and product share for each combination of segment and product. The product share is then categorized as either "Higher Share" or "Lower Share" based on a threshold.

This project provides valuable insights into sales performance, profitability, discounts impact, price tracking, price elasticity, and cross-selling opportunities. The SQL queries presented here can be used as a foundation for further analysis and decision-making in various business scenarios.
